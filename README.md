    ## Project- Spice Garden Restaurant

### Context

In today's digital age, establishing a strong online presence is essential for businesses, including restaurants. The Spice Garden Restaurant, a fictional establishment, currently lacks an effective and engaging online platform to connect with potential customers and showcase its unique culinary offerings. This poses a significant problem as it restricts the restaurant's ability to reach a broader audience and provide essential information to its patrons. The absence of a responsive website limits the restaurant's visibility and hinders its potential for growth in an increasingly competitive industry.

Additionally, it struggles to reach beyond its local audience, missing out on global patrons and the opportunity to foster customer loyalty and engagement. To address these challenges, the restaurant needs a comprehensive website that showcases its culinary offerings and enhances its online presence.

As a novice web developer, design and create a responsive website for the fictitious "Spice Garden Restaurant." The website will serve as an online platform to showcase the restaurant's offerings, provide essential information to potential customers, and offer an engaging user experience.

### Problem Statement

Design a responsive web page for Spice Garden Restaurant, making it accessible to potential customers and enhancing its online visibility.

The website should be designed using HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework to ensure responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes. The project will be divided into multiple sections, each catering to specific content and functionality.

- **Header Section:** The header section will include the restaurant's logo ("Spice Garden") on the left side and a navigation menu on the right side, featuring links to key pages such as Home, About, Menu, Stories, Contact, and Book a Table.

- **Hero Section:** The hero section will feature a captivating background image with the caption "Spice Garden" and "Best Restaurant" centered on the page. Below the image, there will be four equally spaced circular images, each showcasing a signature dish, accompanied by captions.

- **About Section:** The About section will include two images staggered on the left side, while the right side will feature a header ("About Spice Garden") followed by a paragraph describing the restaurant's history and mission. Timings of operation and a contact number will also be provided.

- **Catering Services Section:** This section will highlight the restaurant's catering services. The title "Catering Services" will be centered, followed by three services ("Birthday Party," "Business Meetings," and "Wedding Party") displayed horizontally with icons and descriptions.

- **Menu Section:** The menu section will display the restaurant's specialties. The title "Specialties Our Menu" will be centered, and dishes will be showcased in cards, with each card containing an image, dish name (with price), ingredient list, and an "Order Now" button.

- **Master Chef Section:** Titled "Our Master Chef," this section will feature four chef profiles, each with an image, designation ("Master Chef" or "Chef"), and links to their social media profiles (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram).

- **Book a Table Section:** This section will have a background image and a reservation form on the left side. The form will include fields for Name, Email, Phone, Date, Time, and the number of persons. The "Number of Persons" field will be a dropdown. A "Make a Reservation" button will be placed at the bottom.

- **Testimony Section:** Titled "Happy Customers," this section will feature three testimonials, each containing a circular customer image, a feedback comment, the customer's name, and the text "CUSTOMER."

- **Recent Posts Section:** The "Recent Posts" section will display three blog posts in a row, each with an image, date, blog title, and a "Read more" link.

- **Footer Section:** The footer will consist of two rows. The first row will have three equally spaced columns: one for Spice Garden details and social media links, one for open hours information, and one for newsletter subscription. The second row will display the copyright notice.
